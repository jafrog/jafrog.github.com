Did you know, that you can use hyphen in git commands like 'checkout' or 'merge'? Just like in 'cd' shell command.

{% highlight bash %}
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'
$ git checkout some-branch
Switched to branch 'some-branch'
$ git checkout -
Switched to branch 'master'
{% endhighlight%}
